# Video Game Sales Analysis Project

## Introduction
In this project, I analyzed video game sales data to identify trends and patterns in the industry. I used a dataset of video game sales from various regions, platforms, and genres to analyze the factors that contribute to a game's success or failure.

## Data Description
The dataset I used for this analysis contained information on video game sales from 1980 to 2020. It included details such as the name of the game, the platform it was released on, the year of release, the genre, and the sales figures in various regions. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.

## Steps Taken
### 1. Ask
I started by defining the problem I wanted to solve and the goals of my analysis. I asked questions such as:
* What are the current sales trends in the video game industry?
* What are the most popular platforms?
* What are the most popular genres?
* What are the top selling games?

Then, I determined the scope of my analysis, including the time period, regions, and data sources I wanted to use.

### 2. Prepare and Process

To prepare the dataset for analysis, I first needed to understand it better and identify any cleaning duties that were necessary. Here are the steps I took:

1. Opened the dataset in Excel.
2. Analyzed the raw data to gain insights and identify potential issues.
3. Created pivot tables to identify any anomalies and inconsistencies in the data.

Next, I began the data cleaning process by performing the following tasks:

1. Corrected any typos in game names using the find and replace function (e.g., "PokÃ©mon" -> "pokemon").
2. Standardized platform names to make them more easily understandable (e.g., "2600" -> "Atari 2600", "x360" -> "Xbox 360", "ws" -> "Wonderswan").
3. Used text splitting to isolate the platform developer company from the platform column, making it easier to perform platform-based analysis.

These steps helped to ensure that the dataset was accurate, consistent, and ready for further analysis.
