# Video Game Sales Analysis Project

## Introduction
In this project, I analyzed video game sales data to identify trends and patterns in the industry. I used a dataset of video game sales from various regions, platforms, and genres to analyze the factors that contribute to a game's success or failure.

## Data Description
The dataset I used for this analysis contained information on video game sales from 1980 to 2020. It included details such as the name of the game, the platform it was released on, the year of release, the genre, and the sales figures in various regions. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.

## Steps Taken
### 1. Ask
I started by defining the problem I wanted to solve and the goals of my analysis. I asked questions such as:
* What are the current sales trends in the video game industry?
* What are the most popular platforms?
* What are the most popular genres?
* What are the top selling games?

Then, I determined the scope of my analysis, including the time period, regions, and data sources I wanted to use.
