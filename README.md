# Video Game Sales Analysis Project

## Introduction
The video game industry has grown rapidly over the years, and understanding the trends and patterns within it is crucial for game developers and investors. In this project, I analyzed video game sales data to identify the factors that contribute to a game's success or failure.

## Data Description
The dataset used for this analysis contains information on video game sales from 1980 to 2020. It includes details such as the name of the game, the platform it was released on, the year of release, the genre, and the sales figures in various regions. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and provides a comprehensive view of the video game industry over the past four decades.

## Methodology
### 1. Define the Problem and Goals
The first step in this project was to define the problem I wanted to solve and the goals of my analysis. I asked questions such as:
* What are the current sales trends in the video game industry?
* What are the most popular platforms and genres?
* What are the top selling games?
* What are the top selling publishers?

By answering these questions, I aimed to gain insights into the video game industry and provide valuable information for game developers and investors.

### 2. Prepare and Process

To prepare the dataset for analysis, I first needed to understand it better and identify any cleaning duties that were necessary. Here are the steps I took:
1. Opened the dataset in Excel.
2. Analyzed the raw data to gain insights and identify potential issues.
3. Created pivot tables to identify any anomalies and inconsistencies in the data.

Next, I began the data cleaning process by performing the following tasks:

1. Corrected any typos in game names using the find and replace function (e.g., "PokÃ©mon" -> "Pokemon").
2. Standardized platform names to make them more easily understandable (e.g., "2600" -> "Atari 2600", "x360" -> "Xbox 360", "ws" -> "Wonderswan").
3. Used text splitting to isolate the platform developer company from the platform column, making it easier to perform platform-based analysis.

### 3. Analyze

In this phase, I analyzed the video game sales data to uncover insights and trends. I used Excel to create interactive graphs using pivot tables to display my findings. Some of the key insights I discovered include:

* The top-selling video game genre worldwide is Action, followed by Sports and Shooter.
* North America is the region with the highest total sales, followed by Europe and Japan.
* The most popular platform in terms of sales is the Playstation 2, followed by the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.
* The highest-selling video game, accounting for all platforms, is Wii Sports , followed by Grand Theft Auto V and Super Mario Bros.

I also created several visualizations to help illustrate my findings, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts. These visualizations allow us to easily compare different genres, platforms, and games.

Overall, the analysis phase helped us gain a better understanding of the video game sales data and identify key trends and insights.

### 4. Share and Act

If this project was a real business task I would share my findings with colleagues to gather feedback and identify any areas for improvement. I would discuss potential areas for further analysis and visualizations that could help provide additional insights.

Moving forward, I would work on addressing any new issues or concerns that arise from my discussions with colleagues. This may involve cleaning the data further or creating additional visualizations to better showcase my findings.

Once any new issues have been addressed and I am satisfied with the quality of my analysis and visualizations, my final step would be to share my findings with stakeholders and use the insights to inform decisions and actions that can help drive business success.
